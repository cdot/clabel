# clabel

THIS WORKS, BUT IS UNSUPPORTED. DEVELOPMENT HAS MOVED TO [cdot/clabel-js](https://github.com/cdot/clabel-js)

Derivative of B-label with improved UI and formatting

Run with

perl clabel

and select a CUPS printer to print to, or run with

perl clabel /dev/usb/lp0

to print directly to a printer (and review the responses)

Labels are laid out using the Pango markup format.
